"""
Pagination utilities for capping query limits and offsets to prevent excessive data retrieval and ensure efficient
database queries. This module provides a function to cap the pagination parameters based on configured default and
maximum limits, ensuring that API endpoints that support pagination can enforce reasonable limits on the number of
records returned in a single request while allowing clients to specify their desired pagination settings within those
constraints.
